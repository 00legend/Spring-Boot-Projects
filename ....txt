1. Virtual Bookstore
Develop a user-friendly and efficient virtual platform where book admirers can explore, select and purchase books. This platform will replicate the experience of visiting a physical bookstore in a digital environment, it will give an engaging space where users can have a Digital Book Exploration, Easy selection of books as per their interest they can have detailed book information, and can have a hassle-free shopping of their choice.

The Virtual Bookstore project aims to replicate the experience of browsing and buying books online by taking more than enough information about the particular book, this process of exploring and purchasing books online will give a feel to users just as one would in a physical bookstore. Users will search for books, add them to their shopping cart, and will proceed to checkout. This application provides an engaging and user-friendly interface for bookaholics.

Recommendation System: Implement a book recommendation engine based on user preferences, previous purchases, or ratings. You can use simple algorithms like collaborative filtering or even machine learning models for better recommendations.
User Reviews and Ratings: Allow users to rate books and write reviews. This will add an extra layer of engagement to the platform.
Payment Integration: Add integration with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to make the purchase process more realistic.

Techstack: Spring boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA

### **Implementation Steps**

#### 1. **Setting Up Spring Boot**
- Create a Spring Boot project with dependencies:
  - Spring Web
  - Spring Data JPA
  - Spring Security
  - Thymeleaf (or REST for APIs)
  - MySQL Driver
  - DevTools.

#### 2. **Database Design**
**Entities:**
- `User`: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`.
- `Product`: `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `quantity`, `imageUrl`.
- `Order`: `id`, `userId`, `orderDate`, `status`, `totalAmount`.
- `OrderItem`: `id`, `orderId`, `productId`, `quantity`, `price`.

#### 3. **User Authentication**
- Configure **Spring Security** for user authentication and authorization.
- Use BCrypt for password encryption.
- Implement role-based access for `Admin` and `User`.

#### 4. **Product Management**
- Create APIs or Thymeleaf controllers for:
  - Listing all products.
  - Searching/filtering products.
  - Admin CRUD operations for products.

#### 5. **Order Management**
- Implement the cart and order workflow:
  - Add products to a cart.
  - Place orders and save to the database.
  - Send order confirmation email (optional).

#### 6. **Payment Integration**
- Integrate with PayPal or Stripe APIs for payment processing.
- Store payment transaction details in the database.

#### 7. **Admin Dashboard**
- Build a dashboard for managing products, orders, and inventory.
- Display sales reports and analytics using charts.

### **Sample Code Snippets**

#### **Product Entity**
```java
@Entity
public class Product {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    private String description;
    private double price;
    private int quantity;
    private String imageUrl;

    // Getters and Setters
}
```

#### **Product Repository**
```java
@Repository
public interface ProductRepository extends JpaRepository<Product, Long> {
    List<Product> findByNameContaining(String name);
}
```

#### **Product Controller**
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/products")
public class ProductController {

    @Autowired
    private ProductService productService;

    @GetMapping
    public List<Product> getAllProducts() {
        return productService.getAllProducts();
    }

    @PostMapping
    public Product createProduct(@RequestBody Product product) {
        return productService.createProduct(product);
    }
}
```

#### **Order Service**
```java
@Service
public class OrderService {

    @Autowired
    private OrderRepository orderRepository;

    public Order placeOrder(Order order) {
        // Calculate total amount, save order
        return orderRepository.save(order);
    }
}
```

### **Frontend Integration**
For a simple setup:
- Use **Thymeleaf** to display dynamic product lists and order details.
For a modern approach:
- Build the frontend using **React** or **Angular** and consume REST APIs.

---

### **Deployment**
1. **Dockerize the application:**
   - Create a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for containerized deployment.
2. **Deploy to Cloud:**
   - Use **Heroku** or **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** for deploying your project.

---

### **Bonus Features**
- Add user reviews for products.
- Implement a wishlist feature.
- Introduce multi-currency support for payments.
