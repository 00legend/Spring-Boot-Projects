# Spring-Boot-Projects

Hi, I'm a passionate Java developer currently learning Spring Boot. This project is part of my journey to build real-world web applications using Spring technologies. I'm exploring features like user authentication, database integration with JPA, REST APIs, and dynamic web pages with Thymeleaf. I enjoy solving problems through code and constantly improving my skills to become a better backend developer.
